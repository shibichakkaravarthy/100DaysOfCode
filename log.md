# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created the Skeleton of the app. working on UI, States and props for now

**Thoughts:** Today I accounted a problem which is troubling me very much. I maped through an Array of objects to render the details in a Card Component. I added a onClick event for that and the fuction will do a console.log. But it logged for all cards without clicking. Still figuring it out...

**Link to work:** For Today, clone my repository into your Computer and run 'npm install' and then 'npm start'. Today I didn't had time for creating a link. Sorry!!!
